## Overview

Simple Blog is a simple blogging framework that can be modified and built upon to meet your needs.

It is built to be deployed on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/), upon the [webapp2 framework] (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp2) and [jinja2 template engine](http://jinja.pocoo.org/).

## Motivation

This is one of my projects for my Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree.

See working example here: https://simple-blog-151718.appspot.com

## Installation

Download Simple Blog first.

Simple Blog requires Python 2.7.x. Please ensure it is installed.

You will need to install required third party libraries. To do so, create a directory at the root of Simple Blog and run:
`pip install -t lib -r requirements.txt`

Because Simple Blog is meant to run on Google App Engine, you will need to deploy it to Google App Engine or run it locally.

You can use Cloud SDK for both of these.

To install Cloud SDK, please see instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads

To deploy to Google App Engine, see instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/getting-started/deploying-the-application

To run Simple Blog locally, within the Simple Blog directory, run:
`dev_appserver.py .`

Open a browser and visit: localhost:8080

## Running Simple Blog

Simple Blog is, as you guessed, a simple blog. It allows basic functionality you would need in a blog.

When logged in, a user can:
1. create a new post
