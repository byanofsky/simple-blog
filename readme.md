## Overview

Simple Blog is a simple blogging framework that can be modified and added to to meet your needs.

It is built using the webapp2 framework (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp2) and jinja2 template engine (http://jinja.pocoo.org/). It is built to run in Google App Engine.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

This is one of my projects for my Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree.

## Installation

Simple Blog requires Python 2.7.x

Because Simple Blog is meant to run on Google App Engine, you will either need to upload it to Google App Engine or run it using Cloud SDK.

I recommend Cloud SDK.

To install Cloud SDK, please see instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads

Download Simple Blog.

Within the Simple Blog directory, run `dev_appserver.py .`
